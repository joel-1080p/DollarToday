# A Dollar Today

![dollarToday](https://github.com/joel-1080p/DollarToday/assets/156847809/9560d263-3a05-48a3-8862-129d5957658f)

### HOW IT WORKS

Type a dollar ammount, select the year, and hit enter.
A Dollar Today will tell you how much it would feel like you have in that set year.
If you toggle the switch, it will give you the inverse showing what it would feel like today.

### Example 1:
Let's say you wanted to see how much a $5 milkshake (milk and icecream) in 1993 would feel like today.
Type in 5, and select 1993 and it would feel lake paying $11.84 today.

### Example 2 (Flipping the toggle):
Let's say you wanted to know how much a $2,000 bounty in 1865 (If you turned in a western outlaw) would feel like today.
It would feel like getting rewarded $96,000!

### HOW I USE IT
You can download the files and all of the calculations would be in 1DollarToday/ViewController.swift
You would need to set the UI and map the functions.

### P.S.

Please drop me a note with any feedback you have.
